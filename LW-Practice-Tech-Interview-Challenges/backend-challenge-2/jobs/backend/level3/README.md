# Level 3

In order to reduce no-shows (e.g. golfers not showing up), a club can require the reservation to be paid upfront with a credit card. In this case, fees need to be calculated and split among the payment processor (e.g. Stripe) and us (e.g. to pay your salary ðŸ˜ƒ).

The fee is 3% and is transparent to the golfer. It is split like so:

- 1.9% + 0.30\$ to the payment gateway
- the rest goes to us

Calculate the amount we need to send to our payment gateway and to us.
