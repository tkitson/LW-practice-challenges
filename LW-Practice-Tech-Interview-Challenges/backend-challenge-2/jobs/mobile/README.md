# The Chronogolf Challenge

## Part 1

You just got feedback from our client about our app being slow.
We would like for you to take a look at the code and help us find what could be improved to make our app faster and more responsive.

Code available on [NS Playground](https://play.nativescript.org/?template=play-ng&id=fu2Ljn&v=3)

## Part 2

Now that our app has been adopted widely, we are struggling to keep every user on the last version, which prevents us from keeping a small and simple API.

We would like for you to add a new feature to the app to help forcing users to update.

To do so, we propose to check the store with this URL: [https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?bundleId=com.chronogolf.booking.chronogolf](https://itunes.apple.com/lookup?bundleId=com.chronogolf.booking.chronogolf)
If a new version is available, we want a modal to appear, warning the user about the new version available and preventing him from using the app.

**Feel free to reuse the app from Part1 if you prefer, but to make it simple, we can just bootstrap a new Nativescript app using the CLI**

Good luck!
