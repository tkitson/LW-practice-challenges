# The Chronogolf Challenge

## Guidelines

**The challenge is an Angular application that manages Palindromes. Complete this application by following the instructions in each step.**

## Steps

1. Implement the behaviour to add palindromes to the list. It should only accept palindromes (No complex validation or error handling required).

2. Implement the behaviour to delete a palidrome from the list.

3. Implement the select and unselect behaviour for list items. The text of the selected palindrome should be displayed in the primary color of the application.

4. Update the primary color from green to red `#ed5153` and improve the layout of the list items by aligning the delete button on the right.

5. Implement the filter behaviour so that the list items are filtered by the inputed text, the list should be updated as you type.

## What is a Palindrome?

> A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam or racecar... [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome)

For our application we will only supports basic palindrome: alphabetic characters, spaces and dashes.

### Some Palindromes

- Madam
- Race car
- Pull-up

Good luck!
